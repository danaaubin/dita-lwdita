<title>Highlighting components</title>
<shortdesc>The highlighting components are used to apply formatting styles to text, such as bold and
        italic. Never use these elements when a semantically specific element is available. These
        elements are not intended for use by specializers; they are intended solely for use by
        authors when no semantically appropriate element is available and a formatting effect is
        required.</shortdesc>
